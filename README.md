Inspiration
We were disheartened to learn about the lack of information and resources accessible to the other countries regarding mensuration

What it does
This website is a safe space where women can freely talk about their mensuration, and not be afraid to share their opinion. They could turn to this place if they are stressed or just want to make their day. It is our mission to inform all the women and non-binary people that hygiene is not something that they shouldn't be ashamed of.

How we built it
We built the front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery. The backend was made using Flask, Twilio, and News API. We made a game (MenoPositivity) to raise awareness and speak against negativity

Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we ran into was using Twilio. Since it is our first time using it, it took us long time to implement a server that could host the Twilio API. We had to bring jokes from a third party source that we needed to learn how to use.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Although we all were sleep deprived, we were able to complete the project we aimed for. We are not experienced with backend but we were able to learn within a short period of time by watching and following along with video tutorials and consulting our TCNJ mentors.

What we learned
With the help of teamwork and communication, even the project thats above our league can be possible. We were able to learn the basic elements of Flask and Twilio.

What's next for Monthlies
We want to make our backend more stronger by using the data collected from the survey to a live chart and use the information to better improve our website for broader audience.
